This is on purpose allowing using <strong>hawtio</strong> to inspect the state of the JVM during and after testing. For example to look at the Camel plugin to see route diagrams and profiles with metrics from the completed unit tests. </p>\n<p>Pressing enter in the shell runs the tear down of the unit tests, which for example could unregister Camel from JMX and therefore remove the CamelContext used during testing. When using the <a href="hawt.io/plugins/junit">junit plugin</a> to run unit tests, then these tests will tear down immediately when they complete, and therefore remove any CamelContexts during testing. This may change in the future, allows to keep the CamelContexts alive after testing, giving end users time to inspect the data; and then tear down by pressing a button.</p>\n<h2>Configuring hawtio Maven Plugin in pom.xml</h2>\n<p>In the Maven pom.xml file, the <strong>hawtio</strong> plugin is configured by adding the following in the &#x3C;build>&#x3C;plugin>section:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;plugin>\n  &#x3C;groupId>io.hawt&#x3C;/groupId>\n  &#x3C;artifactId>hawtio-maven-plugin&#x3C;/artifactId>\n  &#x3C;version>1.5.9&#x3C;/version>\n  &#x3C;configuration>\n    &#x3C;!-- configuration options goes here -->\n  &#x3C;/configuration>\n&#x3C;/plugin>\n</code></pre>\n<p>In the &#x3C;configuration> section we can configure the plugin with any of the options mentioned before. For example to log the classpath:</p>\n<pre><code>  &#x3C;configuration>\n    &#x3C;logClasspath>true&#x3C;/logClasspath>\n  &#x3C;/configuration>\n</code></pre>\n<p>And to change the port number from 8282 to 8090 do:</p>\n<pre><code>  &#x3C;configuration>\n    &#x3C;logClasspath>true&#x3C;/logClasspath>\n    &#x3C;port>8090&#x3C;/port>\n  &#x3C;/configuration>\n</code></pre>\n<p>And to set a number of system properties to the JVM, such as the JVM http proxy settings is simply done within the nested &#x3C;systemProperties> tag:</p>\n<pre><code>  &#x3C;configuration>\n    &#x3C;logClasspath>true&#x3C;/logClasspath>\n    &#x3C;port>8090&#x3C;/port>\n    &#x3C;systemProperties>\n      &#x3C;http.proxyHost>myproxyserver.org&#x3C;/http.proxyHost>\n      &#x3C;http.proxyPort>8081&#x3C;http.proxyPort>\n    &#x3C;/systemProperties>  \n  &#x3C;/configuration>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Camel Examples</h2>\n<p>The <a href="http://camel.apache.org/download.html">Apache Camel distributons</a> includes a number of examples, which you can try out using Maven plugins.</p>\n<p>For example to try the Camel console from a shell type:</p>\n<pre><code>cd examples\ncd camel-example-console\nmvn compile\nmvn camel:run\n</code></pre>\n<p>To run the same example with <strong>hawtio</strong> embedded as a web console, you simply do</p>\n<pre><code>cd examples\ncd camel-example-console\nmvn compile\nmvn io.hawt:hawtio-maven-plugin:1.5.9:camel\n</code></pre>\n<p>Where 1.5.9 is the <strong>hawtio</strong> version to use.</p>\n<h3>Adding hawtio plugin to the Apache Camel examples</h3>\n<p>In any Maven pom.xml file you can include the hawtio Maven plugin. For example to include the hawtio plugin in the Camel console example, you edit the pom.xml file in examples/camel-example-console directory. </p>\n<p>In the &#x3C;build>&#x3C;plugin>section add the following xml code:</p>\n<pre><code>&#x3C;plugin>\n  &#x3C;groupId>io.hawt&#x3C;/groupId>\n  &#x3C;artifactId>hawtio-maven-plugin&#x3C;/artifactId>\n  &#x3C;version>1.5.9&#x3C;/version>\n&#x3C;/plugin>\n</code></pre>\n<p>And you can run the console example simply by typing</p>\n<pre><code>mvn hawtio:camel\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the example is started together with the embedded <strong>hawtio</strong> web console, such as the screenshot below illustrates:</p>\n<img src="https://raw.github.com/hawtio/hawtio/master/docs/images/camel-example-console.png" alt="screenshot">',frontmatter:{title:""}}},pathContext:{slug:"/docs/maven-plugins/"}}}});
