This folder contains the generated TypeScript API definition files; so there's not much value in there from a navigation/completeness perspective when noodling the code.</p>\\n<p>So open File -> Project Structure then in the Modules tab select the d.ts folder and click the <strong>Excluded</strong> button. Then if you alt-click on a function call it will take you directly to the TypeScript/JavaScript source code of the implementation (and not prompt you to choose between the .ts and .d.ts files)</p>\\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\\n<p><em>My typescript code fails to compile with missing definitions for 'ng' etc...</em></p>\\n<p>In your plugin code make sure you add a reference path to the <code>includes.ts</code> file under <code>plugins</code>.  This will bring in all the definitions from hawtio-core-dts, hawtio-utilities etc.</p>\\n<p><em>Where can I add typescript definitions for some new dependency I brought in?</em></p>\\n<p>Best place is add or replace the reference path(s) in <code>plugins/includes.ts</code>, then it'll be available to all of your plugin code.</p>\\n<p><em>Can I have multiple plugins in one package?</em></p>\\n<p>Yes!</p>\\n<p><em>My plugin needs to talk to some other thing too, how does that happen?</em></p>\\n<p>Use <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/hawtio-node-backend\\\">hawtio-node-backend</a> to proxy requests</p>\\n<p>Or hand-configure a proxy:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>run <code>npm install --save-dev proxy-middleware</code></li>\\n<li>add this code to your gulpfile at the beginning:</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">var url = require('url');\\nvar proxy = require('proxy-middleware');\\n</code></pre>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Change your 'connect' task to something like this:</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task('connect', ['watch'], function() {\\n  plugins.connect.server({\\n    root: '.',\\n    livereload: true,\\n    port: 2772,\\n    fallback: 'index.html',\\n    middleware: function(connect, options) {\\n      return [\\n        (function() {\\n          var proxyOptions = url.parse('http://localhost:8282/hawtio/jolokia');\\n          // proxies requests from /jolokia to the above URL\\n          proxyOptions.route = '/jolokia';\\n          return proxy(proxyOptions);\\n        })() ];\\n    }\\n  });\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>I get weird compile errors but I didn't change anything!</em></p>\\n<p>It could be a dependency got compiled with an updated typescript version.  Run <code>npm update</code> in your package to update your node modules and try again.</p>\\n<p><em>Something under libs/ got messed up!</em></p>\\n<p>You can just blow away <code>libs</code> and run <code>bower update</code> to re-install dependencies anytime you like.</p>\\n<p><em>A bower dependency I want to install doesn't have <code>main</code> configured at all, what do I do?</em></p>\\n<p>Typically for these cases it's best to run <code>bower install</code> (don't add <code>--save</code>) on the package to get the files, then copy the .js or .css files into your packages <code>dist</code> directory, then configure those js and css files in your package's <code>bower.json</code> file in the <code>main</code> attribute.  That way any package that depends on your code will get the dependent javascript automatically wired into their index.html.</p>\\n<p><em>How do I work on multiple components at once?</em></p>\\n<p>There's a couple options, you can use <code>bower link</code> which sets up a soft-link under libs/ to the dependent component.  However this can mess up typescript compilation.</p>\\n<p>A better option is to soft-link the <code>dist/hawtio-*.js</code> (or whatever the built javascript file is) directly.  Then you can <code>gulp watch</code> in the dependency and <code>gulp</code> in your main project and live reload will kick in whenever you change code in either.  The same approach is handy for .css files.  Then when you <code>bower update</code> after releasing the dependency the soft-link will be replaced with the updated file</p>\\n<p><em>How do I enable debug logging at runtime?</em></p>\\n<p>After the page is loaded, open up the javascript console and paste:</p>\\n<pre><code>localStorage['logLevel'] = angular.toJson(Logger.DEBUG);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Releasing</h2>\\n<p>It's easy!  First make sure you have a README, and a changelog would be good.  Make sure you have a sane version in your bower.json file.  I'd also recommend updating package.json so it's consistent.  Since this is hawtio 2.x stuff all plugins should start at version 2.0.0.  Make sure you've built your plugin and check in any changes.  Then it's time to start the long winded release process of publishing a bower plugin:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><code>git tag 2.0.0</code></li>\\n<li><code>git push &#x26;&#x26; git push --tags</code></li>\\n<li><code>bower register my-awesome-plugin git@github.com:hawtio/my-awesome-plugin.git</code></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>say 'yes' in step 3 and congrats, you're done!  Now your plugin can easily be pulled in by other projects.</p>\\n<p>If you fix an issue and need to make an update it also takes a lot of steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fix issue, update changelog etc.</li>\\n<li><code>bower version patch</code></li>\\n<li><code>git push &#x26;&#x26; git push --tags</code></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>phew, you're done!  Now you can <code>bower update</code> in other packages that pull in my-awesome-plugin as a dependency.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/docs/overview-v2/\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---docs-overview-v-2-b88c7693ab19863d25de.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>The main goals for 2.x are to update to a more recent AngularJS version as well as Bootstrap and Patternfly.

This will bring in all the definitions from hawtio-core-dts, hawtio-utilities etc.</p>\\n<p><em>Where can I add typescript definitions for some new dependency I brought in?</em></p>\\n<p>Best place is add or replace the reference path(s) in <code>plugins/includes.ts</code>, then it'll be available to all of your plugin code.</p>\\n<p><em>Can I have multiple plugins in one package?</em></p>\\n<p>Yes!</p>\\n<p><em>My plugin needs to talk to some other thing too, how does that happen?</em></p>\\n<p>Use <a href=\\\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/hawtio-node-backend\\\">hawtio-node-backend</a> to proxy requests</p>\\n<p>Or hand-configure a proxy:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>run <code>npm install --save-dev proxy-middleware</code></li>\\n<li>add this code to your gulpfile at the beginning:</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">var url = require('url');\\nvar proxy = require('proxy-middleware');\\n</code></pre>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Change your 'connect' task to something like this:</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">gulp.task('connect', ['watch'], function() {\\n  plugins.connect.server({\\n    root: '.',\\n    livereload: true,\\n    port: 2772,\\n    fallback: 'index.html',\\n    middleware: function(connect, options) {\\n      return [\\n        (function() {\\n          var proxyOptions = url.parse('http://localhost:8282/hawtio/jolokia');\\n          // proxies requests from /jolokia to the above URL\\n          proxyOptions.route = '/jolokia';\\n          return proxy(proxyOptions);\\n        })() ];\\n    }\\n  });\\n});\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>I get weird compile errors but I didn't change anything!</em></p>\\n<p>It could be a dependency got compiled with an updated typescript version.  Run <code>npm update</code> in your package to update your node modules and try again.</p>\\n<p><em>Something under libs/ got messed up!</em></p>\\n<p>You can just blow away <code>libs</code> and run <code>bower update</code> to re-install dependencies anytime you like.</p>\\n<p><em>A bower dependency I want to install doesn't have <code>main</code> configured at all, what do I do?</em></p>\\n<p>Typically for these cases it's best to run <code>bower install</code> (don't add <code>--save</code>) on the package to get the files, then copy the .js or .css files into your packages <code>dist</code> directory, then configure those js and css files in your package's <code>bower.json</code> file in the <code>main</code> attribute.  That way any package that depends on your code will get the dependent javascript automatically wired into their index.html.</p>\\n<p><em>How do I work on multiple components at once?</em></p>\\n<p>There's a couple options, you can use <code>bower link</code> which sets up a soft-link under libs/ to the dependent component.  However this can mess up typescript compilation.</p>\\n<p>A better option is to soft-link the <code>dist/hawtio-*.js</code> (or whatever the built javascript file is) directly.  Then you can <code>gulp watch</code> in the dependency and <code>gulp</code> in your main project and live reload will kick in whenever you change code in either.  The same approach is handy for .css files.  Then when you <code>bower update</code> after releasing the dependency the soft-link will be replaced with the updated file</p>\\n<p><em>How do I enable debug logging at runtime?</em></p>\\n<p>After the page is loaded, open up the javascript console and paste:</p>\\n<pre><code>localStorage['logLevel'] = angular.toJson(Logger.DEBUG);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h2>Releasing</h2>\\n<p>It's easy!  First make sure you have a README, and a changelog would be good.  Make sure you have a sane version in your bower.json file.  I'd also recommend updating package.json so it's consistent.  Since this is hawtio 2.x stuff all plugins should start at version 2.0.0.  Make sure you've built your plugin and check in any changes.  Then it's time to start the long winded release process of publishing a bower plugin:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li><code>git tag 2.0.0</code></li>\\n<li><code>git push &#x26;&#x26; git push --tags</code></li>\\n<li><code>bower register my-awesome-plugin git@github.com:hawtio/my-awesome-plugin.git</code></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>say 'yes' in step 3 and congrats, you're done!  Now your plugin can easily be pulled in by other projects.</p>\\n<p>If you fix an issue and need to make an update it also takes a lot of steps:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fix issue, update changelog etc.</li>\\n<li><code>bower version patch</code></li>\\n<li><code>git push &#x26;&#x26; git push --tags</code></li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>phew, you're done!  Now you can <code>bower update</code> in other packages that pull in my-awesome-plugin as a dependency.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"slug\":\"/docs/overview-v2/\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/docs-overview-v-2.json\n// module id = 349\n// module chunks = 187040844506990"],"sourceRoot":""}
